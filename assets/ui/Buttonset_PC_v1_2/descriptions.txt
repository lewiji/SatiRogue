Animation ideas:
if you animate the buttons keep in mind that the pressing hsould have a shorter animation then the release.

let's say you have an animation with 4 frames
[1] [2] [3] [4]

with [1] being the released state and [4] being the pressed state.

the pressing could have a frequence like:
[1] [4] [3]	-energetic press with backlash
[1] [3] [4]	-slower press
[1] [3] [4] [3]	-energetic press with backlash

for the release of the button you could display it smooth
[4] [3] [2] [1]

or you make a fast release like
[4] [3] [1]

since all the animations are delivered in 3 states, you can switch to highlighted or outlined after each animation and let each animation display like this.
Have fun experimenting!
